You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. 
There are no duplicates in list. One of the integers is missing in the list. 
Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.


Get the sum of numbers 
       total = n*(n+1)/2
 Subtract all the numbers from sum and
   you will get the missing number.
