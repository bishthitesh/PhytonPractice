"""
Ishaan recently made a robot which reduces him effort to move things. 
The robot moves from one place to another in a straight line to move things, but it has got a bug in it.
After moving N metres forward, it comes back M meters. 
Now Ishaan wants to know how much total distance does the robot cover if it needs to reach K metres from the starting point
